 This implements an LR parser that is constructed from grammar rules defined
 as Python functions. The grammer is specified by supplying the BNF inside
 Python documentation strings.  The inspiration for this technique was borrowed
 from John Aycock's Spark parsing system.  PLY might be viewed as cross between
 Spark and the GNU bison utility.
 .
 The current implementation is only somewhat object-oriented. The
 LR parser itself is defined in terms of an object (which allows multiple
 parsers to co-exist).  However, most of the variables used during table
 construction are defined in terms of global variables.  Users shouldn't
 notice unless they are trying to define multiple parsers at the same
 time using threads (in which case they should have their head examined).
 .
 This implementation supports both SLR and LALR(1) parsing.  LALR(1)
 support was originally implemented by Elias Ioup (ezioup@alumni.uchicago.edu),
 using the algorithm found in Aho, Sethi, and Ullman "Compilers: Principles,
 Techniques, and Tools" (The Dragon Book).  LALR(1) has since been replaced
 by the more efficient DeRemer and Pennello algorithm.
 .
 :::::::: WARNING :::::::
 .
 Construction of LR parsing tables is fairly complicated and expensive.
 To make this module run fast, a *LOT* of work has been put into
 optimization---often at the expensive of readability and what might
 consider to be good Python "coding style."   Modify the code at your
 own risk!

 ctypesgen is a pure-python ctypes wrapper generator. It can also
 output JSON, which can be used with Mork, which generates bindings for
 Lua, using the alien module (which binds libffi to Lua).
